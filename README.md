# Static-S3-Site
Recently I've had the urge to create a personal/blog site. However, since I'm prepping for my AWS certification I wanted to make this an entirely static site hosted on AWS' S3. All the resources I've managed to find were either outdated or incomplete. This mostly for personal reference, but incase anyone else is looking to do something similar I hope this helps.
